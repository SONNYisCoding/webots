It's that time of year again! Today we're happy to announce the release of Webots R2022a!
And it's packed with some new features, improvements and, of course, bug fixes.

Here we are going to present some of the main new features, but for a comprehensive list of changes please refer to the [ChangeLog](../reference/changelog-r2022.md).


## Conversion to FLU/ENU

What is FLU/ENU
Why

What we have done:

We worked hard to convert all PROTOS and worlds distributed with Webots for you, so that they are ready to use in R2022a.

A mecanism of backward compatibility has been implemented directly in Webots. Unfortunately, it was not possible to make it work in every cases. It will try to convert worlds but cannot convert Protos.

We wrote a guide to help you convert your own protos and worlds to be able to use them in Webots R2022a and benefits from the new features and bug fixes.

We know it is a major change and it can be painful to convert worlds and PROTOS to the new standard. But it is a worthwhile effort, especially if you work with ROS.
